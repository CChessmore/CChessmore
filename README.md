I am Conner Chessmore, a developer interested in a wide array of concepts and ideas in the programming realm.
My Bachelor's degree from Fort Hays State University (FHSU) focused on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and PHP. This included looks into functional programming, using objects and frameworks to streamline the development process, and when to use functional versus object-oriented approaches.

I continued my education at FHSU with a Master's degree in Web Development, wherein I developed a website for a local gym and made a capstone research project on analyzing the methods and practices that make apps and online products effective at forming addictive/habitual behaviors.

Presently, I am working on learning C++ and Python, with some additional exploration of the Data Science areas of coding. I am balancing this with my full-time position as a System Administrator with Great Plains Health, as well as co-owning and operating a local game store in town!

My goal is to transition from System Admin to Software Engineer.
